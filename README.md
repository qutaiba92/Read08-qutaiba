## Evalutaing Conditions and Conditional Statement
There are two type of componante to do decision
1- An expression is evaluated, which returns a value.
2- Conditional Statement says what to do in a given situation

## USING IF...ELSE STATEMENTS
1- An if statement only runs a set of statements if the
condition is true: 
2- An if ... else statement runs one set of code if the
condition is true or a different set if it is fa1se: 
## SWITCH STATEMENTS
A switch statement starts with avariable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value
- JavaScript can convert data types behind the scenes to complete an operation. This is known as type coercion. For
example, a string 'l ' could be converted to a number 1 in the following expression:(' 1' > 0).
As a result, the above expression would evaluate to true.
- JavaScript is said to use weak typing because the data type for a value can change. Some other languages require that you
specify what data type each variable will be. They are said to use strong typing.
